# Coding Challenge 4
# Electric Car Class Implementation

This project involves implementing a basic `Car` class to create an `ElectricCar` class in JavaScript. This will be done by incorporating properties that are distinct to electric vehicles such as batttery charge management. 

## Tasks
-Extend `Car` class to reate `EV` class that includes a `charge` property that represents the current battery charge in percentage.
-Implent a `chargeBattery` method in `EV` class that uses `chargeTo` and sets the battery charge to this value.
-Override `accelerate` method in `EV` class in order to increase the car's speed by 20 km/h and decrease battery charge by only 1%.
-Create `EV` object using test data that was provided and experiment with calling `accelerate`, `brake`, and `chargeBattery` methods.

## Test Data
-Car 1: A 'Tesla' starting at 120 km/h, with a battery cahrge of 23%.
